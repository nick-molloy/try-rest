        <p><span>New findings in the 9/11 case as the FBI released new documents that could link the Saudi government directly to the attacks of September eleventh. This development comes after an executive order came from president Biden, allowing the government to further investigate the event. The document provides information that could prove that the Saudi government supported the high jackers in their attempts to attack the United States. These findings come after the twentieth anniversary of the attacks. The link comes between a student in Los Angeles who was believed to be a Saudi intelligence member. He provided travel assistance, finan-cial support, and lodging to the terrorists, which ultimately aided the attackers in succeeding. The future of this case is unsure as they are not sure what will develop from here.Â </span></p>

        <p>Â Notable Facts About Mike</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Â <span>Small Town Native</span><span>: When I say small, I meanÂ </span><em>small</em><span>.Â  Try 150 people.Â  "I'm from Vance, South Carolina.Â  Everybody knew everybody.Â  It was almost like we were family.Â  I have had a lot of 'cousins' pop up since I've been drafted!"Â  Williams said going to Clemson wasn't necessarily a big difference as the town itself.Â  Although larger than Vance, is still small by most standards.Â  Going to Los Angeles?Â  Williams calls that a "huge difference."Â  "Just the whole city life and traffic, I'm not used to that!Â  I'm used to getting up and going where I need to be, not sitting in traffic.Â  So that's (been) a little different for me."</span></li>
        <li><span>Avid Gamer</span><span>: Like many of his Chargers teammates, Williams loves to play video games in his spare time.Â  His favorite? NBA 2K.Â  "It's a game I've played since I was a kid.Â  Hanging out with my friends playing video games was just something I enjoyed outside of playing sports."Â  His new game of choice is Madden.Â  "I also recently just started playing mainly because I'm in the (new) one.Â  I'm trying to get halfway decent!Â  It's weird seeing myself because just playing the game, I've looked up to those guys so knowing I'm in the game, it's crazy."</span></li>
        <li>Pregame Mix: Along with praying, Williams listens to music before games.Â  He says he puts his phone on shuffle.Â  "I listen to a lot of different things. I like to listen to Meek Mill, Lil Uzi, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9msKu75qs">Young Thug and Future</a>."Â  Williams cites <a href="https://twitter.com/reactjpg/status/1262616863185481729">Meek Mill </a>as his favorite artist. Â  Â Â </li>
        <li><span><span>Mike Williams also plays and inspired the name of my fantasy team ðŸ˜Ž</span></span></li>
